# Describe the benefits of high availability and scalability in the cloud #

* High availability in cloud computing refers to ensuring maximum availability of resources, regardless of disruptions or events that may occur.
* Azure is a highly available cloud environment with uptime guarantees depending on the service, which are part of the service-level agreements (SLAs).
* Scalability in cloud computing refers to the ability to adjust resources to meet demand.
* Cloud resources can be scaled up or down depending on demand, which also helps to reduce costs by only paying for what is used.
* Scaling generally comes in two varieties: <vertical> and <horizontal>
* <Vertical> scaling involves increasing or decreasing the capabilities of resources such as adding more CPUs or RAM to the virtual machine.
* <Horizontal> scaling involves adding or subtracting the number of resources, such as adding additional virtual machines or containers.
* It can be done automatically or manually.

# Describe the benefits of reliability and predictability in the cloud #


* Reliability and predictability are two crucial cloud benefits that help you develop solutions with confidence.
* Reliability is the ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function. It's also one of the pillars of the Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework.
* The cloud, by virtue of its decentralized design, naturally supports a reliable and resilient infrastructure.
* Predictability in the cloud lets you move forward with confidence. Predictability can be focused on performance predictability or cost predictability.
* Performance predictability focuses on predicting the resources needed to deliver a positive experience for your customers. Autoscaling, load balancing, and high availability are just some of the cloud concepts that support performance predictability.
* Cost predictability is focused on predicting or forecasting the cost of the cloud spend. With the cloud, you can track your resource use in real time, monitor resources to ensure that you’re using them in the most efficient way, and apply data analytics to find patterns and trends that help better plan resource deployments.
* By operating in the cloud and using cloud analytics and information, you can predict future costs and adjust your resources as needed. You can even use tools like the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) or Pricing Calculator to get an estimate of potential cloud spend.

# Describe the benefits of security and governance in the cloud #

* Security and governance are important benefits in the cloud that help ensure compliance and protect resources
* Cloud features support governance and compliance through set templates, cloud-based auditing, and automatic software patches and updates
* Different cloud solutions offer different levels of security control, such as infrastructure as a service allowing maximum control or platform as a service and software as a service handling patches and maintenance automatically
* Cloud providers are typically well-equipped to handle issues such as DDoS attacks, making networks more robust and secure
* Establishing a good governance footprint early can help keep the cloud footprint updated, secure, and well-managed.

# Describe the benefits of manageability in the cloud #

* Management of the cloud refers to managing the resources within the cloud environment, such as being able to automatically scale resource deployment based on need, deploy resources using preconfigured templates, monitor the health of resources and automatically replace failing resources, and receive automatic alerts based on configured metrics.
* Management in the cloud refers to how you manage your cloud environment, such as through a web portal, command line interface, APIs, or PowerShell.

# Knowledge check #
>1.Which type of scaling involves adding or removing resources (such as virtual machines or containers) to meet demand?
    >>Horizontal scaling is adding or subtracting the number of resources.
>2.What is characterized as the ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function?
    >>Reliability is the ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function, and it is one of the pillars of the Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework.
